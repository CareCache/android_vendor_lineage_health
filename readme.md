CareCache
================================

CareCache (also called "Lineage Health Mod") allows applications to
store and share health-related data in a secure environment that never leaves
your device and gives the user strong control over the data flow.

While this is a LineageOS' project, it is designed to be used on
any Android distribution that provides the standard Android SDK APIs at level
27 or higher (Android 8.1) as well.

See the [project website](https://carecache.github.io/android_vendor_lineage_health) for documentation and APIs.
